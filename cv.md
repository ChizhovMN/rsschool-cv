 ## About myself:
 
 I want to become a programmer. Keep learning.
 
 ## Code example:
 
 Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
```
function friend(friends){
  return friends.filter( a => a.length === 4)
};
```
